        <h3>You cant learn webpack from shiny tools</h3>
        <p>
          If you ask on reddit or discord how to approach the frontend ecosystem
          they will tell you to learn one thing at once.
        </p>
        <p>
          A common recommendation is to start with JavaScript, and then move on
          to React when you are ready. You should use create-react-app (CRA) to
          create your project. You can learn webpack “later”.
        </p>
        <p>
          The problem with this strategy is that later never comes. And suddenly
          you have grown out of CRA and need to extend it. So you eject your app
          and get this thrown in your face:
        </p>
        <img
          src={require('../../images/webpackmedium.webm.gif')}
          width="100%"
        />
        <p>
          You get not only one – but three webpack config files. At a total of
          989 lines of code. And that’s just the webpack configs. There are more
          config files and build scripts that got generated for you. That is
          overwhelming.
        </p>
        <p>
          The webpack config file is well commented, but it doesn’t help when
          you have no idea how webpack works.
        </p>
        <p>You can’t learn webpack by reading a huge config file.</p>
        <p />
        <h3>A strategy for learning webpack that works</h3>
        <p>You already know how to learn a new language or tool:</p>
        <ol className={styles.bookFeatures}>
          <li>You start by reading about the most basic features.</li>
          <li>
            Then you write some code yourself implementing these basic features
            in a small project.
          </li>
          <li>It works! Your confidence grows.</li>
          <li>
            Now you are ready for some more advanced concepts. You read about it
            and repeat the process.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          An essential aspect of learning programming is to write code yourself.
          Only reading is not enough.
        </p>
        <p>
          You know how this works because you have already learned JavaScript,
          React and probably lots of other languages and tools.
        </p>
        <p>
          The feeling of knowing how everything works – including the build
          setup – in your app is awesome.
        </p>
        <p>
          With such depth in your skills and knowledge, you are a frontend dev
          that knows how to set up any kind webpack project. You are able to go
          in and upgrade, tweak and optimize existing webpack projects.{' '}

        <p>The book is made up of three parts:</p>
        <p>
          <b>Part 1: The Getting started tutorial </b>
          You'll jump straight into coding your first React app with webpack.
          You start from scratch and you will finish up with a complete webpack
          project that you can put in production. This tutorial is designed to
          get you up and running quickly.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Part 2: Production-ready apps with webpack </b>
          You’ll learn how to configure an awesome developer experience that
          makes you super productive <i>and</i> use tools and techniques to get
          the lowest possible bundle size for the production build. You’ll also
          learn about the internals of webpacks. Loaders, plugins, manifests and
          chunks will no longer feel like magic
        </p>
        <p>
          <b> Part 3: Recipes</b> Even the webpack pros have to look up how to
          configure specific things like Vue, React, Typescript, etc. In this
          part of the book, you will have recipes that you can use to create the
          app you want to create - so you don't have read long and outdated
          medium-articles to get the code you need.

        Hi, I'm Jakob Lind (
        <a href="https://twitter.com/karljakoblind">@karljakoblind</a>
        ). I'm a full stack developer and independent consultant. I have 10
        years of experience as a professional dev and I have been coding as a
        hobby since I was a kid.
        <br />
        <br />
        I’m a strong believer in sharing and helping others. I have a blog and I
        work on open source projects.
        <br />
        <br />
        The best way to learn how to program is to do hard and deep work. There
        are no shortcuts.
